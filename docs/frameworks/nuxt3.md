# Nuxt 3 + Adminizer (minimal Sequelize fixture)

This guide describes a minimal Nuxt 3 integration with Adminizer using Sequelize + SQLite.

Reference example: `fixture-nuxt3/`.

## 1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install adminizer nuxt sequelize sqlite3
npm install -D tsx typescript
```

## 2) Project structure

```text
fixture-nuxt3/
  app.vue
  nuxt.config.ts
  server/
    middleware/adminizer.ts
    models/Post.ts
    utils/sequelize.ts
    utils/adminizer.ts
```

## 3) Sequelize bootstrap

`server/utils/sequelize.ts`:

- creates a singleton Sequelize instance,
- registers Adminizer system models,
- initializes one custom model (`Post`),
- runs `sync()`.

## 4) Adminizer bootstrap

`server/utils/adminizer.ts`:

- creates a singleton Adminizer middleware,
- uses `SequelizeAdapter`,
- sets `routePrefix: "/adminizer"`,
- disables auth for a quick local demo.

## 5) Nuxt server middleware

`server/middleware/adminizer.ts`:

- intercepts requests only for `/adminizer*`,
- forwards them to `adminizer.getMiddleware()`,
- passes all other requests through to Nuxt.

## 6) Run

```bash
npm install
npx tsx --version
npm run dev
```

Open: `http://localhost:3000/adminizer`

## 7) Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- This fixture is intentionally minimal and focused on wiring.
- It uses `Adminizer` and `SequelizeAdapter` from the `adminizer` package root export.
- For production use, enable Adminizer auth and move secrets to environment variables.
- Add more Sequelize models in `server/models` and extend `models` config in `server/utils/adminizer.ts`.

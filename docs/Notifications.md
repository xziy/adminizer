# Notification System Documentation

## System Overview

The notification system is a mechanism for sending and managing real-time notifications to users through a web interface. It operates on a publisher-subscriber principle, where various services can send notifications, and clients (users' browsers) receive them in real time.

## Key Components

### AbstractNotificationService
A base class for all notification types that provides:

- **Connection Management** - tracks all connected users and their clients
- **Message Delivery** - distributes notifications to all active clients
- **History Storage** - saves notifications in the database for later viewing
- **Read Status** - tracks which notifications have been viewed by the user

### NotificationHandler
A central coordinator that:

- **Registers Services** - manages different notification types
- **Routes Notifications** - directs notifications to the appropriate service
- **Provides Access** - enables working with all registered services

## How It Works

### 1. Client Connections
When a user opens the web interface, their browser establishes a connection with the notification server. The system remembers this connection and associates it with the specific user.

### 2. Sending Notifications
Any service can send a notification by specifying:
- Notification type (class)
- Message for the user
- Additional data

The system automatically:
- Saves the notification to the database
- Sends it to all of the user's active connections
- Updates unread notification counters

### 3. Receiving Notifications
Clients receive notifications in real time through the established connection. If the user is offline, notifications are saved and will be shown upon next connection.

### 4. Notification Management
Users can:
- View notification history
- Mark notifications as read
- Search through notification history
- Receive only unread notifications

## Notification Types

The system supports various notification types through separate services. Each type can have:
- Its own icon and color
- Specific delivery logic
- Different access rights

## System Advantages

- **Scalability** - supports multiple users and notification types
- **Reliability** - preserves notifications even when clients disconnect
- **Flexibility** - easy to add new notification types
- **Security** - controls access rights to different notification types
- **Performance** - efficient delivery through persistent connections

The system provides seamless user interaction by delivering important information in real time while maintaining history for future reference.


## System Initialization

The notification system is initialized when the application starts through the `bindNotifications()` function, which:

1. **Creates a handler** - central coordinator for all notifications
2. **Registers services** - connects various notification types:
    - `GeneralNotificationService` - general notifications
    - `SystemNotificationService` - system events and notifications

## Integration with Adminizer

The system is tightly integrated with the main Adminizer framework:

### Helper Methods for Developers

Adminizer provides convenient methods for sending notifications:

#### 1. General Notification Sending
```typescript
await adminizer.sendNotification({
    notificationClass: 'general',              // Notification type
    title: 'New Message',                      // Title
    message: 'You have a new message',         // Message text
    userId: 123,                               // User ID (optional)
    metadata: { important: true }              // Additional data
});
```

#### 2. System Events
```typescript
// General system event
await adminizer.logSystemEvent(
    'System Update', 
    'The system has been successfully updated',
    { version: '2.0.0' }
);

// CRUD operation events
await adminizer.logSystemCreatedEvent('New User', 'User John Doe created');
await adminizer.logSystemUpdatedEvent('Profile Update', 'User profile updated');
await adminizer.logSystemDeletedEvent('Record Deletion', 'Record deleted from database');
```

## Default Notification Service Types

### GeneralNotificationService
- **Purpose**: General user notifications
- **Usage**: Notifications from other users, alerts, reminders

### SystemNotificationService
- **Purpose**: System events and automatic notifications
- **Usage**: System events, audit trails, action logging

## Access Rights

The system automatically registers access rights for each notification type through `AccessRightsHelper`. Users can only receive notifications for which they have permissions.

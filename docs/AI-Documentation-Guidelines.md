# AI Documentation Guidelines

This guide defines how AI systems should format and label generated documentation for this repository.

## Mandatory rule for AI-generated content

Every AI-generated or AI-assisted document must start with a warning block:

```md
> ⚠️ **AI-DRAFT**
>
> This document was generated by a neural network and may contain inaccuracies or mistakes.
```

## Writing standards

1. Use clear, task-oriented headings.
2. Keep examples minimal and executable.
3. Use English for function names, variable names, and code comments.
4. Avoid ambiguous phrases and unsupported assumptions.
5. Re-check all paths, script names, and configuration keys before publishing.

## Quality checklist

- The AI warning block is present at the top.
- The text clearly explains limitations and possible errors.
- Commands and snippets match the current repository structure.
- Cross-links in `docs/index.md` are updated.

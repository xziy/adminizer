# Documentation README

## AI-generated documents policy

If any documentation page was generated fully or partially by a neural network, add a visible warning block at the top of the document.

Use this format:

```md
> ⚠️ **AI-DRAFT**
>
> This document was generated by a neural network and may contain inaccuracies or mistakes.
```

This rule is required for all generated pages to help readers validate critical technical details before production use.

## Required checklist for generated docs

- Add the `AI-DRAFT` warning at the very beginning of the file.
- Clearly state that neural network output can contain mistakes.
- Keep examples reproducible and verify commands before publishing.
- Prefer concise sections with explicit headings.
- Keep function names, variable names, and comments in English.

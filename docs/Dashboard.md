# Widgets

### WidgetHandler
 WidgetHandler is a static class that process handling widgets maked with abstract class of widgets. Widget can have 4 types: 
 * info [InfoBase] - give information without any action
 * switcher [SwitcherBase] - switcher change boolean state 
 * action [ActionBase] - start action by click on widget
 * link [LinkBase] - provide link logic in widget
 * custom [CustomBase] - mount JS/html widget into dashboard widget
 
Widgets have magic on loading sails project such as model or service. This function work on 
`sails.config.adminpanel.autoloadWidgetsPath: string`. Widget is a class which created by abstract class and pass it in WidgetHanler.add

> ⚠️ Any new Widget type must be added to `WidgetType` inside `/lib/widgets/widgetHandller.ts` file. Additionally, within this handler, the logic for the new type needs to be implemented inside the `getAll` method specifically created for the added type.

> ⚠️ You can access widget handler by call method of admin panel `sails.hooks.adminpanel.getWidgetHandler()`

> ⚠️ You can add widget by call method of admin panel `sails.hooks.adminpanel.addDashboardWidget(widget: WidgetType) `


WidgetBase instance has this props:
- `ID`: string, required 
- `name`: string, 
- `description`: string, 
- `icon`: string | null, default = null
- `department`: string,  For group access rights by department
- `size`: {h: number, w: number} | null; size of box on client
- `widgetType`: 
        /** An informational widget type that only shows the state */
		"info" |
		 Binary state switching 
		"switcher" |
		/** Run task */
		"action" |
		/** Change location, or open in new tab */
		"link" |
        /**  any tast from js file */
		"custom"
 
The new type of widgets created on the WidgetBase will have their own field which have to be as `public abstract readonly`

**Promotions in the interface**
<!-- `ISPUBLIC: True` when requesting a group or product, the promotion will be calculated based on Worktime, Enable
Promotions that are displayed in the interface cannot be single, for the flag `isjoint: true` will not be taken into account even if the flag is` Ispublic: true`.

> ⚠️  You can use this mechanism to display the user's personal promotions, as he transfers the user when calculating the promotion

The public promotion can turn on a banner, or make some other action if such a connection is available through Emmiter `Emmit (` Apply-Promotion`, Promotion) ` -->

**Example**
First we have to create widget type `abstractCustom`. In the way like this.

export default abstract class CustomBase extends BaseWidget{
    /** Widget background css (color, Image) */
    public abstract readonly  backgroundCSS: string | null;
}

Then we will add type to `widgetHandller.ts` 

type WidgetType = (SwitcherBase | InfoBase | ActionBase | LinkBase | CustomBase);

Add new type to `BaseWidget`

public abstract readonly widgetType:
		/** An informational widget type that only shows the state */
		"info" |
		/** Binary state switching */
		"switcher" |
		/** Run task */
		"action" |
		/** Change location, or open in new tab */
		"link" |

		"custom"
	;


Next Handling Custom Widgets. Add logic to `getAll` method:

            else if (widget instanceof CustomBase) {
				if (AccessRightsHelper.havePermission(`widget-${widget.ID}`, user)) {
					widgets.push({
						id: `${widget.ID}_${id_key}`,
						type: widget.widgetType,
						api: `${config.routePrefix}/widgets-custom/${widget.ID}`,
						description: widget.description,
						icon: widget.icon,
						name: widget.name,
						backgroundCSS: widget.backgroundCSS ?? null,
					})
				}
            }

Then we`ll create Instance of this widget type

class CustomOne extends CustomBase {
	readonly ID: string = 'site_custom';
	readonly department: string = 'test';
	readonly description: string = 'Widget Custom One';
	readonly icon: string = 'dog';
	readonly name: string = 'Site Custom';
	readonly widgetType = 'custom';
	readonly backgroundCSS = '#da4fcf'

}

And export it as function which create our instances

const setCustomsWidgets = () => {
	WidgetHandler.add(new CustomOne())
}

`module.exports = { setCustomsWidgets }`

Then call `setCustomsWidgets` inside `bootstrap.js`


### customizable and programmable promotion

<!-- **Completed**
The adapter supplied with the core has support for promotion configurations for certain groups, or/and dishes
Each record in the model will create a copy of the custom promotion.So that such a promotion created by the user through the admin panel is
distinguishable, we use a sign of `Creedby: 'adminpanel'` -->


**Programmable**
<!-- Since the promotion is a copy of the class, we can realize any logic of such a promotion.

> ⚠️ We do not recommend using promotions to describe complex promotions, use the Promotions adapter for this

The Promotion should be implemented as an adapter from the abstract class `@webresto/core/adapters/promotion/AbstractPromotion.ts` and added to
the model via> `PromotionAdapter.addPromotionHandler()`. The adapter is responsible for recording transactions in an external source or syncing
from an external source by implementing the abstract class `AbstractPromotionAdapter`. -->

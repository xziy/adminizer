Adminizer is a modern admin panel built as an independent module for Node.js.  
The backend is written in TypeScript, and the frontend uses React, providing high modularity and flexibility.  
The system is specifically designed to be **framework- and ORM-agnostic**, running directly inside the Node.js Runtime.  
Thanks to this approach, Adminizer can be integrated into any server-side application, regardless of its architecture.

The project is **open-source**, **free to use**, and focused on building an **open community**.  
We would like to express special thanks to **Konstantin Zolotarev**, who laid the foundation with the **sails-adminpanel** project, which we later reworked and generalized.

The core principle of Adminizer is **maximum extensibility**.  
The admin panel can be configured and expanded **at runtime** without requiring rebuilds or server restarts.  
We aimed to make the system as easy to integrate as possible: just install the package and immediately gain access to a powerful admin interface.  

Adminizer allows you to:
- Read and write data from **any resource model (RM)**.
- Connect **multiple resource models** across different sources.
- Flexibly manage **user access rights** for reading and writing data.
- Quickly build **personal dashboards**, admin panels, and **TMDP solutions** for industrial use cases.
- Easily extend and customize for any project requirements.

Key features:
- **Modern tech stack:** ESM modules, React-based interface, flexible control components.
- **Production ready:** Supports complex configurations with multiple databases or models.
- **Scalable and extensible:** Create your own controls, modules, and customize admin logic.

**Adminizer** is the perfect choice for quickly building powerful administrative interfaces and server infrastructure.

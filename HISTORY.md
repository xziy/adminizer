## 4.3.6
- Added an OpenAI-powered data agent to the fixture that queries the database through `DataAccessor` and registers it as the default AI assistant model.
- Documented environment variables and tool usage in `docs/OpenAI-Data-Agent.md`.

## 4.3.5
- Anchored the AI assistant panel as a fixed overlay that shifts the entire layout width instead of living inside the content container.
- Persisted the chat open state and selected model across Inertia navigations via a shared viewport manager and updated documentation.

## 4.3.4
- Replaced the AI assistant modal with a persistent right-side workspace that claims one quarter of the viewport when opened.
- Added a dedicated panel component and layout margin handling so the main application content resizes alongside the chat.

## 4.3.3
- Enabled the AI assistant in the fixture configuration with the dummy model and ensured the backend build wires controller endpoints.
- Documented that the fixture ships with the in-memory assistant for local testing.

## 4.3.2
- Added AI assistant chat mode with header toggle, in-memory history, and backend API scaffolding.


## 4.2.1
- Renamed MediaManager parent association to `parent` to resolve Sequelize naming collision.
## 4.1.4
- Fixed Sequelize system model registration errors in tests.
## 4.1.3

- Added material-icons dependency and troubleshooting notes

## 4.1.2
- Added documentation on assigning icons using the Lucide set.
- Updated widget example to reference Lucide icons.

- Added system model tests for Waterline and Sequelize.


## 4.2.1
- Fixed failing tests by adding case-insensitive model lookup and resolving Sequelize association naming conflicts.

## 4.2.2
- Explicit foreign key names now avoid collisions between attributes and associations in Sequelize.

## 4.3.1
- Added TypeScript Umzug migration for system models at `src/migrations/umzug/0001.ts` (SQLite fixture-compatible). Join table naming normalized to lowercase (`groupapuserap`). Updated docs in `docs/Database-Migrations-Umzug.md` and examples for tsx-based runs.
